# License

The Coordination Trilemma project uses **dual licensing**:

1. **Academic Paper Content** (LaTeX source, PDF output, article text) → **CC-BY 4.0**
2. **Software & Infrastructure** (build scripts, Docker files, workflows) → **AGPLv3**

## Academic Paper Content

**Licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC-BY 4.0)**

The academic paper content includes:
- All LaTeX source files in `src/tex/`
- All markdown versions in `src/md/`
- Generated PDF outputs
- The article text and its intellectual content

**See:** [ARTICLE-LICENSE.txt](ARTICLE-LICENSE.txt) for full CC-BY 4.0 license text

**Summary:**
- ✅ You may share, copy, and redistribute the material
- ✅ You may adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the material
- ✅ For any purpose, even commercially

## Software & Infrastructure

**Licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)**

The software and infrastructure includes:
- Build system (Makefile)
- Scripts in `scripts/`
- Docker files in `docker/`
- GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Build and deployment infrastructure
- Verification and security scripts

**See:** [SOFTWARE-LICENSE.md](SOFTWARE-LICENSE.md) for full AGPLv3 license text

**Summary:**
- ✅ You may use, modify, and distribute the software
- ✅ You may use it for any purpose, including commercial
- ⚠️ You must disclose the source code when distributing
- ⚠️ You must license derivatives under AGPLv3 (copyleft)
- ⚠️ **Network use is distribution** - if you run modified versions as a service, you must provide source to users
- ⚠️ You must state changes made
- ⚠️ You must include copyright and license notices

## Documentation

Documentation files in `docs/` and root (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.) are considered part of the software infrastructure and are licensed under **AGPLv3**.

However, documentation may reference or quote from the academic paper content, which remains under CC-BY 4.0.

---

## Rationale for Dual Licensing

### Why CC-BY for the Paper?
- **Academic Freedom:** Allows wide dissemination and building upon the ideas
- **Attribution:** Ensures proper credit while allowing derivative works
- **Standard Practice:** Common license for academic publications
- **Open Access:** Aligns with open scholarship principles

### Why AGPLv3 for Software?
- **Copyleft:** Ensures improvements to build/deployment infrastructure remain open
- **Network Provision:** AGPL's network clause prevents proprietary SaaS wrappers
- **Community Benefits:** Forces sharing of enhancements
- **Strong Protection:** Strongest copyleft license for infrastructure code

## Which License Applies?

**Simple Guidelines:**

| What | License | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| LaTeX source (`src/tex/`) | CC-BY 4.0 | Academic content |
| Markdown source (`src/md/`) | CC-BY 4.0 | Academic content |
| Generated PDFs | CC-BY 4.0 | Academic content |
| Makefile | AGPLv3 | Build infrastructure |
| Scripts (`scripts/`) | AGPLv3 | Build infrastructure |
| Docker files (`docker/`) | AGPLv3 | Build infrastructure |
| Workflows (`.github/`) | AGPLv3 | CI/CD infrastructure |
| Documentation (`docs/`) | AGPLv3 | Project documentation |
| README, CONTRIBUTING | AGPLv3 | Project documentation |

**When in Doubt:**
- If it's about the **ideas, proofs, arguments** → CC-BY 4.0
- If it's about **how to build, deploy, verify** → AGPLv3
