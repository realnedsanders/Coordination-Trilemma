# Baseline configuration for corruption dynamics model
# These parameters represent default assumptions from Appendix B

# Population
n_enforcers: 100
n_steps: 200

# Integrity distribution
# Represents M_integrity in the paper
integrity_mean: 5.0      # Average integrity motivation
integrity_std: 2.0       # Variation in integrity

# Extraction opportunities
# Represents U_e in the paper
extraction_mean: 3.0     # Average extraction opportunity per step
extraction_std: 1.5      # Variation in opportunities

# Detection parameters
# Represents P_detection and detection cost
base_detection_prob: 0.3 # Baseline probability of detection
detection_cost: 10.0     # Cost if caught (reputation, punishment)

# Oversight structure
# 'hierarchical' implements the infinite regress problem (top enforcers have less oversight)
# 'flat' gives everyone equal oversight
# 'none' removes all oversight
oversight_structure: "hierarchical"

# Dynamic effects
integrity_decay: true           # Corruption reduces future integrity
integrity_decay_rate: 0.05      # Rate of decay per extraction event
corruption_contagion: true      # Seeing corruption reduces others' integrity
contagion_rate: 0.02            # Rate of contagion effect
